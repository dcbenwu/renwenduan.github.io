i touch Github in these days and i find a way to build a blog free and very clear - on the Github, I am very thankful to [Github](https://github.com/) give us a very cool platform to learn and deal with work together with my colleagues. Also I am very thankful to [Hux](http://huangxuan.me) give me a very Beautiful Example for blog , i use it directly ! very nice!

Also I want to write some issue in my python projects. Maybe this will be helpful to me and you ! I leave my contact in the bottom of website. If you have some question, you can contact me in these ways .

I hope i can run a very long distance on the python way . at last i have a word to share with you :
**If you want to make your way in the world , you must learn work hard while you are still young!**
